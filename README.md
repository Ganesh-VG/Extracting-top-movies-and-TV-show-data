# Extracting, Cleaning, and Visualizing Data on Premier Movies and TV Shows on Streaming Platforms
For this project, my assignment involved retrieving specific data regarding the top 50 movies and top 50 TV shows available across various streaming platforms. I accomplished this task by scraping data from the JustWatch website using the Request and BeautifulSoup libraries in Python. Subsequently, I structured this data into a CSV file format for further analysis. To enhance data exploration and visualization, I utilized seaborn and matplotlib libraries within a Colab notebook.
Furthermore, to provide a comprehensive overview of the extracted data, I created a Tableau dashboard. This dashboard serves as a dynamic visualization tool, enabling users to interactively explore and analyze the streaming platform content insights.
